          Saxophone Colossus is the sixth studio album by American jazz
          saxophonist Sonny Rollins. Perhaps Rollins's best-known album, it is
          often considered his breakthrough record. It was recorded on June 22,
          1956, with producers Bob Weinstock and Rudy Van Gelder at the latter's
          studio in Hackensack, New Jersey. Rollins led a quartet on the album
          that included pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Doug Watkins, and
          drummer Max Roach. Saxophone Colossus was released by Prestige Records
          to critical success and helped establish Rollins as a prominent jazz
          artist.
