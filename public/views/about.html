        Rollins was born in New York City to parents from the United States
        Virgin Islands. The youngest of three siblings, he grew up in central
        Harlem and on Sugar Hill, receiving his first alto saxophone at the age
        of seven or eight. He attended Edward W. Stitt Junior High School and
        graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. Rollins
        started as a pianist, changed to alto saxophone, and finally switched to
        tenor in 1946. During his high school years, he played in a band with
        other future jazz legends Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew, and Art Taylor.
        <br />
        <br />
        After graduating from high school in 1948, Rollins began performing
        professionally; he made his first recordings in early 1949 as a sideman
        with the bebop singer Babs Gonzales (trombonist J. J. Johnson was the
        arranger of the group). Within the next few months, he began to make a
        name for himself, recording with Johnson and appearing under the
        leadership of pianist Bud Powell, alongside trumpeter Fats Navarro and
        drummer Roy Haynes, on a seminal "hard bop" session. In early 1950,
        Rollins was arrested for armed robbery and spent ten months in Rikers
        Island jail before being released on parole; in 1952, he was re-arrested
        for violating the terms of his parole by using heroin. Between 1951 and
        1953, he recorded with Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Charlie
        Parker, and Thelonious Monk. A breakthrough arrived in 1954 when he
        recorded his famous compositions "Oleo", "Airegin", and "Doxy" with a
        quintet led by Davis that also featured pianist Horace Silver, these
        recordings appearing on the album Bags' Groove. In 1955, Rollins entered
        the Federal Medical Center, Lexington, at the time the only assistance
        in the U.S. for drug addicts. While there, he volunteered for
        then-experimental methadone therapy and was able to break his heroin
        habit, after which he lived for a time in Chicago, briefly rooming with
        the trumpeter Booker Little. Rollins initially feared sobriety would
        impair his musicianship, but then went on to greater success. Rollins
        briefly joined the Miles Davis Quintet in the summer of 1955.

        Later that year, he joined the Clifford Brown–Max Roach quintet; studio
        albums documenting his time in the band are Clifford Brown and Max Roach
        at Basin Street and Sonny Rollins Plus 4. After the deaths of Brown and
        the band's pianist, Richie Powell, in a June 1956 automobile accident,
        Rollins continued playing with Roach and began releasing albums under
        his own name on Prestige Records, Blue Note, Riverside, and the Los
        Angeles label Contemporary. His widely acclaimed album Saxophone
        Colossus was recorded on June 22, 1956, at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in
        New Jersey, with Tommy Flanagan on piano, former Jazz Messengers bassist
        Doug Watkins, and his favorite drummer, Roach. This was Rollins's sixth
        recording as a leader and it included his best-known composition "St.
        Thomas", a Caribbean calypso based on a tune sung to him by his mother
        in his childhood, as well as the fast bebop number "Strode Rode", and
        "Moritat" (the Kurt Weill composition also known as "Mack the Knife").

        A long blues solo on Saxophone Colossus, "Blue 7", was analyzed in depth
        by the composer and critic Gunther Schuller in a 1958 article. Sonny
        Rollins "St. Thomas" (1956) MENU0:00 Improvisation from St. Thomas
        starting immediately after the melody Problems playing this file? See
        media help. In the solo for "St. Thomas", Rollins uses repetition of a
        rhythmic pattern, and variations of that pattern, covering only a few
        tones in a tight range, and employing staccato and semi-detached notes.
        This is interrupted by a sudden flourish, utilizing a much wider range
        before returning to the former pattern. (Listen to the music sample.) In
        his book The Jazz Style of Sonny Rollins, David N. Baker explains that
        Rollins "very often uses rhythm for its own sake. He will sometimes
        improvise on a rhythmic pattern instead of on the melody or changes."
        Ever since recording "St. Thomas", Rollins's use of calypso rhythms has
        been one of his signature contributions to jazz; he often performs
        traditional Caribbean tunes such as "Hold 'Em Joe" and "Don't Stop the
        Carnival," and he has written many original calypso-influenced
        compositions, such as "Duke of Iron," "The Everywhere Calypso," and
        "Global Warming." In 1957 he married the actress and model Dawn Finney.
        In 1956 he also recorded Tenor Madness, using Davis's group – pianist
        Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones. The
        title track is the only recording of Rollins with John Coltrane, who was
        also a member of Davis's group. At the end of the year Rollins appeared
        as a sideman on Thelonious Monk's album Brilliant Corners and also
        recorded his own first album for Blue Note Records, entitled Sonny
        Rollins, Volume One, with Donald Byrd on trumpet, Wynton Kelly on piano,
        Gene Ramey on bass, and Roach on drums.
